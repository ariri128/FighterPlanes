Team Members: Arya Kamat & Bianca Bowonthamachakr

Week 11 Assignment

Task 1 - Completed by Bianca B (edited Player.cs)

Task 2 - Completed by Arya K. and Bianca B. Both worked together to decide on enemy two's movement and how to code it. Arya edited EnemyTwo.cs and GameManager.cs after logistics were figured out.

Week 12 Assignment

Task 1 - Completed by Arya in GameManager.cs

Task 2 - Completed by Bianca and Arya in Coin.cs and GameManager.cs. Arya created a coin prefab with the sprite animation.
         Bianca edited the coin spawning rate and area (GameManager.cs) and made the coin add to the score while Arya made 
         the coin despawn after a few seconds (Coin.cs).

Extra - Bianca edited PlayerController.cs so the player only moves on the bottom half of the screen like from week 11.
        Arya recorded the example video.
